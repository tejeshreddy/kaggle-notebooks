## [Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic)
This is an IPython Notebook for the Kaggle competition, Titanic Machine Learning From Disaster. This [Notebook](titanic-analysis.ipynb) aims at performing EDA(explanatory data analysis) on the dataset along with generating a [submission.csv](catboost_submission.csv) by running several classifier model.

## Goals for this note book

### Data Handling
- Importing Data with Pandas
- Cleaning Data
- Exploring Data through Visualizations with Matplotlib and Seaborn

### Data Analysis
Training on supervised ML models like:
- Decision Tree
- Gradient Boosting Trees
- CatBoost
- KNN
- Logistic Regression
- Naive Bayes
- Linear SVC
- Stochastic Gradient Decent

### Valuation of the Analysis
- Cross validation metrics validated on local
- Submiter output of the CatBoost(accuracy: 81.66%) results from the IPython Notebook to Kaggle
